### How to rotate a structure in VMD ###
(http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/mailing_list/vmd-l/21427.html):

set sel [atomselect top "resid 10"] set com [measure center $sel weight mass] set matrix [transaxis z 45]
$sel moveby [vecscale -1.0 $com] $sel move $matrix $sel moveby $com
Here they rotate around Z axis.
