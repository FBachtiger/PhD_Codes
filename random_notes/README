These are prep files which I used as part of the larger HIN machinery.
* prep_clusters.sh ->outputs the idx.dat file which contains all the indexes of icy OWs in the format required for the modules writen in the HIN program

* visualise_nuclei.tcl -> to be used with VMD, load VMD then in TCL console 'source visualise_nuclei.tcl' this will allow you to color and visualise the icy OWs

* coloring.f90 is a fortran  program which preps a colorfile to be used in conjuction with VMD, see above.

* vmd.info contains some useful commands I used throughout my PhD
