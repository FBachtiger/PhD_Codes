This Repo contains the following - each folder has a detailed explanation of what it is
1. HGB -> folder with all the code necessary to create any length HGA chain, either (de)protonated at the C6 site or methyl-esterified
2. VMD_PLUMED_input -> outputs a plumed.dat file which is used in conjuction with the Pumed_HIN code.  
3. Random notes 
#4. HIN_modules -> a slimed down version of Gabriele's HIN code, containing all the modules I wrote over the years
